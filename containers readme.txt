1. Set
(i) Stores the values in sorted order. ( ascending to descending)
(ii) Stores only unique values.
(iii) Elements can only be inserted or deleted but cannot be modified.
(iv) We can erase more than 1 element by giving start iterator and end iterator position.
(v) Traversal using iterators.
(vi) Sets are implemented as Binary Search Tree.
-------------------------------
2. Multiset
(i) Stores elements in sorted order.
(ii) It allows storage of multiple elements.
(iii) We can erase more than 1 element by giving start iterator and end iterator.
Note:- All other properties similar to set.
--------------------------
3. Unordered_set
(i) Elements can be stored in any order. ( no sorted order )
(ii) Stores only unique values.
(iii) Hash-table used to store elements.
(iv) We can erase only the element for which iterator position is given.
Note:- All other properties similar to set.
------------------------
4. Unordered_multiset
(i) Elements can be stored in any order.
(ii) Duplicate elements can be stored.
(iii) Hash-table used to store elements.
(iv) We can erase only the element for which iterator position is given.
Note:- All other properties similar to set.
